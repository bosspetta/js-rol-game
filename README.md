# JavaScript Rol Game ðŸ”®

Quick start:

```code
> yarn # npm install
> yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```code
> yarn watch # npm run watch
```

We use sass for styling, you can turn on watch-mode too for that

```code
> sass --watch scss:css
```
